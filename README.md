# cpp-beginnings

CPP-Beginnings is Colin's C++ learning adventure. In the end, the `main.exe` file will bring up a command line interface to select each of the modules/executables in the `src` directory. In it's current state, each module would need to be compiled separately.

## Installation

Use [git](https://git-scm.com/) to clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chain52/cpp-beginnings.git
```

Please use the C++ compiler of your choice to compile and run each of the executables.
Further installation instructions will be provided in a later commit due to lack of knowledge and config with CMake at this time.
